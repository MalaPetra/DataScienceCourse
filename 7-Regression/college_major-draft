#Question: Based on your analysis, 
#would you conclude that there is a significant association between college major category and income?

head(college)

# 173 observation, 19 variables

college$major_category <- as.factor(college$major_category)

boxplot(median/1000 ~ major_category, data = college, main = "Income versus Category", ylab = "Income (thousands of dollars)", las = 2)

# We can see that the data is skewed

# Reordering category

college <- college[order(college$major_category),]

# When we apply a linear model to this data, linking Income to all Majors, the default output intercept is the mean of the referenced major (alphabet sorted, with Agriculture first), the gradient coefficient of other majors is the difference of the mean of that major to the referenced one, and the p-value of those coefficients is the probability of a t-test if that mean and the referenced mean is different.

fit <- lm(median ~ major_category, data = college)
summary(fit)$coef   

#From this result we can get some information:
# - mean of median of Income from major agriculture is 43,500
# - difference of mean of median of Income of Arts from Agriculture & Natural Resources  is- 5,450, and p-value of this difference is 0.31, which implies that the difference is not significant
# - the same interpretation can be done for coefficients of other variables
